This projects goal is to determine the properties of the 'extraneous' matter observed in the universe. We call this dark matter and 
are trying to find possible properties of dark matter and possible candidates based on actions observed in cosmic scales.

This is the beginning of the end. This directory will be uploaded to Github on a regular basis in order to maintain the version.
The old project was started in Java and will provide the framework, however once this project is setup the computational performance
will be higher as it is written in C++, with a main script and a few objects. The analysis will be done in python and the GUI and
simulation display will be done in Java. The entire program will be run through a simple program in terminal, that can be translated
into CMD line.

Principles used:






Assumptions:
donut/closed universe: this can also be described as there is translation symmetry in all 4 cardinal directions in this 2-D simulation.
conservation of energy in collisions, applied through conserving relative velocity in the form: sgn(p1)*sgn(p2)*(vi1-vi2)=(v2f-v1f)


Codes:
"#0124abcd" end of output file
"#1111" program successful execution - outputted to console with exit message.
